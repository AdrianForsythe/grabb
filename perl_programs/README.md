# Perl programs

These are programs that use only perl and basic unix commands and do
not call any programs that need to be separately installed.

- kmer\_bait\.pl

    + It is an alternative to using mirabait for exact 31-mer
      matching.
	+ It is less efficient than mirabait. Therefore it is recommended
      to install mirabait (not v 4.0.2).

- create\_readpool\.pl

    + It is an alternative to using seqtk to extract reads that
      matched to the bait
	+ It is less efficient than seqtk. Therefore it is recommended
      to install seqtk.
