MIRA 4.0rc4
-----------

This is the fourth Release Candidate of MIRA 4.0. Which means: things should be
pretty stable by now and bugs erradicated. The documentation hasn't caught up
completely yet, especially walk-throughs are missing. But things should be
pretty understandable even so. I hope.

Users who haven't used the MIRA 3.9 development series ABSOLUTELY MUST read
the documentation as things have changed quite a lot. Read at least, in the
MIRA Definitive Guide, the sections describing the new assembly description
files ("manifest files"); and have a look at the chapters describing the
results of MIRA; and the utilities in the package:

     3.5. Configuring an assembly: files and parameters
          3.5.1. The manifest file: introduction
          3.5.2. The manifest file: basics
          3.5.3. The manifest file: defining the data to load
       9. Working with the results of MIRA
      10. Utilities in the MIRA package

Furthermore, you might want to skim through the following chapters:

       4. Preparing data
       5. De-novo assemblies
       6. Mapping assemblies
       7. EST / RNASeq assemblies
       8. Parameters for special situations

Please report oddities in 4.0rc4 immediately so that I can iron them out
before the final release of 4.0.


MIRA 4.0 is the result of almost exactly two years of work since MIRA 3.4 came
out and much has changed. A lot behind the scenes, but also interesting things
for everyone, most notably in speed and quality terms. The most important
changes for users: the interface. Please absolutely do consult the section on
manifest files in the documentation!

Main improvements made to simplify life:
- flexibilised parametrisation to easily define input data and assembly job:
  the "manifest" configuration files allow using concepts of read groups as
  well as segment orientation & segment placement
- SAM output via convert_project, simplifies interaction with outside world
  (gap5, tablet etc.pp)
- full GFF3 input and output compatibility, using Sequence Ontology,
  translation to and from gap4/gap5
- CASAVA 1.8 read naming for the new Illumina read name scheme
- new sequencing "technology" TEXT for unspecified data, i.e., from databases
  like NCBI etc.
- lots of other improvements left and right which add up ;-)

Main speed improvements:
- faster contig handling routines, improves de-novo assembly times with Ion
  Torrent or 454 / Solexa hybrid by 30%
- faster mapping routines, allows MIRA to more or less gracefully handle
  projects with several thousand reference sequences. Useful for mapping
  against EST / RNASeq assemblies.
- faster handling of deep coverage RNASeq and genome data (to be improved
  still)
- faster kmer counting & smaller footprint in RAM and on disk
- faster checking of template restrictions
- optimized: faster data reading, does not need to count reads beforehand
  anymore
- lots of other improvements left and right which add up ;-)

Main assembly quality improvements:
- new "fire & forget" mode of MIRA which basically should reduce misassemblies
  in result files to zero: earlier version of MIRA would dump out
  misassemblied contigs (with markers pointing at the misassembly), now
  contigs dumped out do not contain any misassembly (at least none which MIRA
  could discover).
- new automatic extaction of "large contigs" at the end of a genome de-novo
  assembly.
- improved assembly quality for ultra-high coverage Solexa RNASeq data contigs
  (new parameter -CL:rkm)
- better handling of sequencing libraries with uneven coverage (Nextera)
- lots of other improvements left and right which add up, like, handling of
  newer MiSeq and Ion data, lossless digital normalisation etc.pp ;-)

Documentation
- rewritten in large parts for manifest files
- started to update walkthrough for newer public data sets.

Other internal changes:
- lots of reshuffled/reworked code
- improved gcc warnings
- improved build environment, now out-of-the box building on more Linux
  distros and Mac OSX
- better and simplified code due to transitioning to C++11
- new MAF format v2



Changes for the 3.9.x development line since MIRA 3.4.0:
========================================================
4.0rc4
------
- improvement: simple variations in coverage which are not repeats are now
  handled gratiously, i.e., these do not break contig building. Seems to be
  extremely important for some Nextera libraries which can have some terribly
  uneven coverage.
- improvement: the automatic adaptor clipping was a tad too overzealous
  for some genome data and clip perfectly velida data in very rare cases.
- major bugfix: segment placements were not checked rigorously enough. E.g.,
  paired-end Illumina would also accept a mate-pair placement of its reads.
- major bugfix: paired-reads libraries were essentially broken since 3.9.11
  and reads were often assigned a wrong partner.
- improvement: the automatic overcall editor is now configurable and defaults
  to correct only 454 and Ion data.
- bugfix: some coverage values in the assembly info file contained temporary
  values from during the assembly, not from the end result.
- bugfix: when MIRA was started from a location not in path, it would not
  always automatically find "miraconvert" and fail at the extraction of large
  contigs in de-novo genome assemblies.


4.0rc3
------
- binaries now recognise themselves when run as "mira4", "mira4bait" and
  "mira4convert". Note: the canonical name should be those without "4" in the
  name though.
- small bugfix: error code was not >0 in certain situations
- mira now searches the binaries for itself and miraconvert in the directory
  the called binary was installed, then in the $PATH environment.
- change: gap4da result type now always turned off by default
- new parameters: -HK:mhpb:rkrk
- loading of files in the manifest: a file type can now be explicitely given
  via the EMBOSS-like double colon scheme. E.g.: data = fastq::file.dat
- bugfix: miraconvert -A did not work
- building: m4 configuration files now in the "m4" directory, not "config/m4"
- bugfix: the shell script to show how to extract large contigs now always
  written for genome assembly projects even if automatic extraction failed.
- data checks: MIRA now halts if it does not correctly recognise read pairs
  due to unknown read naming schemes.


4.0rc2
------
- speed improvement: extracting the consensus of an assembly via miraconvert
  is now faster by a factor between 1.3 and 4.5 (depending on number of
  strains present and a couple of other things)
- improvement: determination of "large contigs" did not handle well projects
  with corrected PacBio reads, fixed.
- convenience: when using -DI:trt, MIRA now creates temporary dir names for
  the target directory so that several runs of MIRA can be started in parallel
  using the same manifest file but the temporary data of these runs do not
  interfere with eachother
- bugfix: Smith-Waterman alignments entered an infinite loop in rare cases
- bugfix: "miraconvert -r C" produced IUPACs
- bugfix: miraconvert did not evalute the complete path of the result file but
  always wrote to current directory
- bugfix: target install missed a && in progs/Makefile.am
- bugfix: loading of assemblies (in mira and miraconvert) could fail
- bugfix: saved diginorm multiplier values in MAF files led sometimes to
  MAF parsing errors.
- bugfix: contig coverage statistics did not always correctly account for
  diginorm reads
- fix for OSX: better binaries which should behave like Unix binaries
- small fix for compiling on Cygwin


4.0rc1
------
- for de-novo assemblies, MIRA now automatically extracts 'large contigs' into
  additional result files
- new info file: "largecontigs". Only written for genome denovo.
- saving of "AllStrains" FASTA or FASTAQ now happens only if more than one
  strain is present in the assembly (mira and convert_project)
- new behaviour in mapping assemblies: reads overhanging the reference
  sequence left and right are trimmed back by default to the boundaries of the
  reference sequence. Can be controlled via new parameter -SB:tor
- added new file type in manifest: .exp for loading single EXP files (compare
  to "fofnexp")
- added new file type in manifest: ".fa". Behaves like ".fna"
- fix segfault when read access to /tmp directory is denied
- bugfix: merging of reads did sometimes not work as intended (introduced in
  3.9.2)
- bugfix: convert_project does not stop anymore on template problems
- bugfix: MAF output for projects with several strains now immediately
  convertable to SAM
- bugfix: FASTQ files in MS-DOS format led to parsing problems
- bugfix: possible endless loop in mapping projects with -AS:nop>1
- bugfix: miraconvert -n with an empty file selected all contigs/reads, now
  selects none (as one would expect)
- renaming of all major MIRA binaries to have "mira" as prefix. Most important
  change: "convert_project" is now "miraconvert"
- renamed and changed behaviour of all NAG_AND_WARN parameters. Now three
  options: stop, warn, no
