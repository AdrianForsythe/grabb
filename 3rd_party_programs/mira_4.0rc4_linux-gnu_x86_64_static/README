1. What's new?
==============

For a complete list of changes since a specific version, please consult
CHANGES.txt, or for older updates, src/mira/CHANGES_old.txt of the source
package distributions.

Current stable versions will have major.minor.sub-version of 4.0.x while
development version will have a branch identifier of 4.1.x (respectively 3.9.x
until the official release of 4.0).


2. What's provided?
===================

You have downloaded the binary package of MIRA. It consists of binaries,
documentation, a directory with small demos and a directory with some support
files.

Binaries provided:
 - mira: for assembly or mapping of sequences
 - miramem: estimating memory needed to assemble projects. Realised through
   link to the mira binary.
 - miraconvert: for converting sequencing related file types into other
   types. Includes various options for processing, filtering etc.pp. Realised
   through link to the mira binary.
 - mirabait: quickly bait sequences from a large set.Realised through link to
   the mira binary.
Note: the above is just only one binary ("mira"), the others are just soft
links pointing to mira.

Scripts provided:
 - fasta2frag.tcl: fragmenting sequences into smaller, overlapping
   subsequences. Useful for simulating shotgun sequences. Can create
   subsequences in both directions (/default) and also paired-end sequences.
 - fixACE4consed.tcl: Consed has a bug which incapacitates it from reading
   consensus tags in ACE files written by the MIRA assembler (and possibly
   other programs). This script massages an ACE file so that consed can read
   the consensus tags.

Documentation provided:
See section 4 "Documentation"


3. Installation
===============

The binaries (in directory "bin") are statically linked and self
contained, they should work with any Linux kernel >=2.6. On Mac OSX, they
may work on version 10.5 and should work on all versions >= 10.6.

Copy the binaries (and scripts if you want) into a directory in your path
environment (or add the extraction directory to your path variable) and you
are ready to go.

Support files for the Staden GAP4 (GAP5) assembly finishing tool and consed
are in the "support" directory. Please refer to the documentation of the
respective package on how to integrate them into your environment.


4. Documentation
================

Documentation in HTML and PDF format can be found in the 'docs' directory.

Provided files:
 - DefinitiveGuideToMIRA.html
   Full documentation in HTML format
 - DefinitiveGuideToMIRA.pdf
   Full documentation in PDF format

If you are new to MIRA, I suggest you start reading the following chapters in
the full documentation:

 - Introduction (always)
 - Installation (eventually)
 - Short usage introduction to MIRA3 (always, although that chapter is geared
   a bit towards Sanger)
 - Then
    - Assembly of 454 data with MIRA3 (when working with 454 sequences)
    - Assembly of Ion Torrent data with MIRA3 (when working with Ion Torrent
      sequences)
    - Solexa sequence assembly with MIRA3 (when working with Solexa sequences)
    - Assembly of EST data with MIRA3 (when working with EST data)
 - Working with the results of MIRA (always)
 - Utilities in the MIRA package (eventually)
 - Assembly of hard genome or EST projects (always)
 - Some advice when going into a sequencing project (eventually)


5. Demos
========

A few small usage examples for genomic and EST assembly are in the 'minidemo'
directory. As the demos rely on file links, this directory will have to be
unpacked under a Unix operating system. Unpacking it with WinZip/WinRAR/other
Windows applications and then transferring the directory to Linux will NOT
work.

Simply go into the directory and execute the runme.sh scripts (and have a look
at them if you wish).

However, these demos can be rather simplistic, so please do read the
documentation.
